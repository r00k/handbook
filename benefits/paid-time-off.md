# Paid Time Off

This is the policy for the US offices. There is an [alternate policy if you are
located in Sweden][stockholm].

Our vacation policy is that employees can use their own judgment when taking time off and there will not be a set limit of time off per year that must be adhered to.

Taking time off can affect thoughtbot's cash flow, project schedules, and client expectations, so we appreciate being informed as far ahead as possible.

Use your best judgement and coordinate with your team, clients, and management to figure out whether some time you want to take off makes sense.

Once you've identified the time you'll be taking off, [adjust your weekly schedule][team-schedule] to include the time off & proper category of PTO, [email admin][admin-email] and make sure the rest of your team and clients know you'll be off. Also, update your [personal thoughtbot calendar][thoughtbot-calendar].

Whenever possible, time off requests are granted, taking into account operating requirements. If you've submitted your time off far enough in advance, you can assume that it is approved unless you hear otherwise.

If you take an extended period of time off (more than 3 weeks) this is considered a leave of absence and will fall under the appropriate [leave of absence policy][leave-of-absence].

## Eligibility

Salaried employees are eligible for paid time off, which can be used for sick, personal and vacation time.

Apprentices are eligible for paid time off as well, but time off should be limited due to the abbreviated time in the program.
