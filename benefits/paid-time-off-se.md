# Sweden Paid Time Off

This is the policy for Sweden. There is an [alternate policy if you are located
in the US][us].

## Holiday Time Off

In Sweden, every employee is entitled with at least 25 days' holiday (work days)
every annual year. In addition, there may be extra holidays per your employment
agreement. Our holiday-earning year runs from 1 April to 31 March. 

Our goal with this policy is to have a standard Swedish holiday policy and to
follow the Annual Leave Act.

### Pay During Holiday

In addition to the current monthly salary, a holiday increment/allowance of 0.8%
of the monthly salary per day's holiday is payable. On termination of
employment, the remaining increment is paid with the final salary.

We do not include variable pay such as commissions and bonuses in holiday pay
calculations.

The number of days of annual leave with pay is to be calculated in the following
way. The number of days when the employee has been completely absent from work
without pay is subtracted from the days that the employee has been in the
employer's service during the year (period of employment). The period of
employment includes absence due to annual leave, lay-offs or absence that
affords an entitlement to holiday pay, such as free days that fall during such
periods of absence. The difference is divided by 365 days. This factor is
multiplied by twenty-five. Where the calculation results in a fraction, it shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

### Saved Holiday

Up to 5 days of unused paid holiday can be saved for a maximum of five years.

The employer and employee must agree on how saved holidays are to be taken. 

The saved days' holiday must be taken in the order in which they were saved. It
is not possible to take saved daysâ€™ holiday and save new ones in the same year. 

### Unused Holiday

Unused holiday that remains when the employment ceases is remunerated at 5.4% of
the employee's current monthly salary per day's holiday.

## Sick Time Off

Sick pay shall be paid according to the Swedish Act on Sick Pay taking the
following into consideration.

The sick pay period comprises the first 14 calendar days when the employee has
been absent for illness. For the day the employee falls ill (the qualifying day)
no sick pay is paid. Between days 2-14 days, you receive 80% of salary as sick
pay. After 14 days, it becomes unpaid leave.

A new period of illness commencing within five calendar days from the end of an
earlier illness period shall be considered a continuation of the prior illness
period and both periods shall be counted as one period. The calendar days in
between shall not be included in the illness period.

A right to sick pay for employees hired for a fixed period of time of less than
a month does not accrue until the employee has commenced the employment and
thereafter been employed for 14 calendar days before the event of the illness.

### Notice to the employer

An employee who becomes ill and is therefore unable to work shall notify the
company as soon as possible. Furthermore, the employee shall, as soon as
possible, inform the employer of when the employee expects to be able to return
to work.

In cases of extended illness or issues with notification, the company request
written confirmation of having been ill and information as to the extent to
which the employee's working capacity has been reduced because of the illness.
The confirmation does not have to contain information about the nature of the
illness. The employer shall not be obligated to pay sick pay before the employee
has provided the confirmation.

## Brief Leave with Pay

Brief leave with pay means a short leave during at the most one day with full
pay. In the case of a close relative's funeral, the leave may also include up to
two travel days if necessary.

Brief leave with pay may be granted in the following cases:

* Own wedding.
* Own 50th birthday.
* First time visit to doctor or dentist in case of emergency illness or
  accident.
* Visit to hospital after a letter of referral from company doctor or another
  doctor assigned by the employer, and prescribed return visits.
* An employee who has worked part of a day and thereafter needs to leave the
  workplace for the rest of the day because of a work injury, will receive a
  brief leave with pay for this time. One precondition in order to receive wages
  for the brief leave is that the work injury does not lead to sick leave for more
  than seven days counted from the day of falling ill according to the Swedish Act
  on National Insurance.
* Death of a close relative.
* Funeral for a close relative.
* Urn lowering for a close relative.
* Sudden severe illness of co-habiting close relative of the employee.

The term close relative means husband/wife, co-habitee under circumstances
similar to marriage, children, grandchildren, siblings, parents, parents-in-law
and grandparents. 

A request for brief leave with pay shall be made with as much notice as
possible. The reason for the brief leave should be explained.

There is no deduction in salary for approved brief leave.

## Parental Leave

An employee, who according to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Parental
Leave would like to exercise their right to such leave, shall notify the
employer thereof at least two months before the commencement of the leave or, if
it is not possible, as soon as possible. In the notification, the employee shall
also state the time period that the leave is intended to comprise and the type
of leave that is invoked. The same shall apply to a leave in connection with an
employee bringing home a foster child or adopted child.
